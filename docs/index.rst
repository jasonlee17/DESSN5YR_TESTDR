Data Release Package documentation
==================================

The SN program consisted on 5 years of observations using the Dark Energy Survey instrument, finding Type Ia Supernovae up to cosmological redshifts :math:`z>1.1`.

This public data release encompases the full set of light-curve measurements obtained, as well as any ancillary data products needed to constrain the cosmological expansion rate model parameters.
