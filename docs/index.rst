Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program 5YR
========================================

.. topic:: The DES Supernova Program 5-year Data release.
   
   The Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN) consisted on 5 years of observations using the Dark Energy Survey instrument, finding Type Ia Supernovae up to cosmological redshifts :math:`z>1.1`.

   This is the **full public data release** of DES-SN (DES-SN5YR) containing all data products used to compute the cosmological result from the full 5 years of photometrically classified supernovae (SNe) combined with a sample of low-redshift SNe. 

   Instructions to download the full data release and its accompanying python utility package can be found below.


.. Overview of DES-SN 5-year Data release 
.. ======================================

.. 0 - DATA
..   Transient light curves from DES-SN, measured with DIFFIMG and SMP photometry pipelines, and also including SALT3 model fitted curves.

.. 1 - Simulations
..   DES mocks used for testing and validation of the DES cosmological pipeline. 

.. 2 - LCFIT_MODEL
..   The trained SALT3 SED time-series used in DES-SN5YR cosmological analysis.

.. 3 - CLASSIFICATION
..   Classification probabilities for the DES SNe used in the DES-SN5YR cosmological analysis.

.. 4 - DISTANCES_COVMAT
..   Distances and Hubble Diagram, global SN sample parameters :math:`\alpha, \beta, \gamma, M_0`, and Statistical and Systematic covariance matrices.

.. 5 - Cosmology
..   Likelihood used, and obtained chains from CosmoMC_  and emcee_ 

.. 6 - DCR_CORRECTIONS
..   The Wavelength-dependent photometrical corrections to our observed transients

.. 7 - PIPPIN_FILES
..   The PIPPIN_ input files for reproducing the cosmological SNIa analysis.

The DES-SN5YR utility package 
=============================

We release basic utilities for using this data. To install this package simply clone this github repo and install locally. This is also one way to obtain the full dataset.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git clone https://github.com/BrunoSanchez/DESSN5YR_TESTDR.git
  $ cd DESSN5YR_TESTDR
  $ pip install -e .


Acquiring the Full Release dataset
----------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash
   
  $ downloaddessndr <dest_dir>


After this, in order to find your dataset globally in your system you should set up the environment variables

.. code-block:: bash

  $ export DES5YRDR_DATA_ROOT='<dest_dir>'
  $ export DES5YRDR_DATA='<dest_dir>/DES-SN5YR'


Examples of use of this Data Release
====================================

We provide some Jupyter Notebooks with examples to load and read this data, and produce some example figures. These are in the ``docs/tutorial`` directory, or in the Tutorial section on [readthedocs](https://desdrtest.readthedocs.io).

This package provides some utilities that can be imported in a Python session as


.. code-block:: python

  >>> from dessndr import utils, data
  >>> phot = utils.PhotFITS(os.path.join(data.DES5YRDR_DATA, '0_DATA/DES-SN5YR_DES'))
  >>> lc = phot.get_lc(phot.cid_recs[0]))
