Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program 5YR
========================================

.. topic:: The DES Supernova Program 5-year Data release.
   
   The Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN) consisted on 5 years of observations using the Dark Energy Survey instrument, finding Type Ia Supernovae up to cosmological redshifts :math:`z>1.1`.

   This is the **full public data release** of DES-SN (DES-SN5YR) containing all data products used to compute the cosmological result from the full 5 years of photometrically classified supernovae (SNe) combined with a sample of low-redshift SNe. 


Overview of DES-SN 5-year Data release 
======================================

0 - DATA
  Transient light curves from DES-SN, measured with DIFFIMG and SMP photometry pipelines, and also including SALT3 model fitted curves.

1 - Simulations
  DES mocks used for testing and validation of the DES cosmological pipeline. 

2 - LCFIT_MODEL
  The trained SALT3 SED time-series used in DES-SN5YR cosmological analysis.

3 - CLASSIFICATION
  Classification probabilities for the DES SNe used in the DES-SN5YR cosmological analysis.

4 - DISTANCES_COVMAT
  Distances and Hubble Diagram, global SN sample parameters :math:`\alpha, \beta, \gamma, M_0`, and Statistical and Systematic covariance matrices.

5 - Cosmology
  Likelihood used, and obtained chains from CosmoMC_  and emcee_ 

7 - PIPPIN_FILES
  The PIPPIN_ input files for reproducing the cosmological SNIa analysis.
